# Neo Surveys:
### A basic survey web application made using Nodejs and Reactjs with custom data persistence.

## How to run the project:
- Clone the project by executing the following git command:
```
git clone "https://github.com/Riya1302/Neo-Surveys-Backend.git"
```
### The node backend:
- Once finished, we need to start our backend server. In order to do that, we navigate to the backend folder from the inside of our cloned repository folder with the following command:
```
cd .\neo-surveys-backend\
```
- We now will load the backend's node modules via npm like this:
```
npm i
```
- After all node modules are loaded we can start our server using the node command like this:
```
node index.js
```
- All set now the backend is up and working.
